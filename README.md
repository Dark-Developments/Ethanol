        <p>Autism Client is an addon for Meteor Client specifically focused on making it more fun to grief :D</p>
        <p>This will be a mix of modules made by other people and by me personally as this is a project for me to learn.</p>

# Features for now:
## Modules:

</div>

- **FlightAntikick:** Moves you down on a tick-based timer. Added in to substitute the lack of a "Normal" mode antikick for velocity flight in MeteorClient (not a great antikick it's just something). Bind it to the same key as Flight. (Credits to Trouser Streak :D)
- **Censorship:** Censors all ips so its streamer friendly :D
- **Autism Meltdown:** Makes you spin around as fast as you want.
- **Orsond Armor:** Gives you Leather armor that keeps changing colors like a rainbow. (Creative Only)
- **KillAura+:** Best Kill Aura on earth fr :D
- **HeadSit:** Makes you able to sit on peoples heads when you click on them lmao.
- **Skill Spam:** Spams incredibly fast using the /skill command issue.
